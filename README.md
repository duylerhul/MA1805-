note: Im a first time coder and have little experience about coding, my last time coding was in secondary in 7 grades

The motivation for this project originated from the frequent, annoying use of a specific emoji by a friend. My hardest technical challenge, however, was drawing the unique shapes for the feet and hands using only basic p5.js commands. I also struggled to remove the solid black fill inside the eyes and mouth. Later, I discovered the simple solution was removing the CHORD parameter from the arc() functions, which draws an open curve instead of a filled shape. Although I knew the correct fix, I decided to keep the filled shapes because I feel they give the emoji a more intimidating appearance.

[02.movement](02.movement/index.html)
The spark for this coding challenge came directly from the simple mechanics of table hockey. Initially, my greatest struggle wasn't the code itself, but deeply understanding what each command was actually telling the computer to do. I challenged myself to swap the original square shape for a circle, but quickly found the bounce logic much harder than expected. The key difficulty lay in knowing that the collision check must rely on the radius (size / 2) of the circle, not the center point, to determine when the object's edge hits the canvas wall. If I used the full size, the ball would look like it was bouncing off an invisible boundary. Which was the things I found out later when I was giving up on it and choose the rectangle instead.

As a first time coder, I found the concepts impossible to grasp. I tried many complex methods, but they were still too hard to understand. Ultimately, I decided to stick with the easiest example you initially provided.

I took a picture of a military parade in my home country. I also have a video of the event, but I don't know the proper code or method to embed it here. Similarly, I recorded some audio from the parade, but I'm having trouble getting the file uploaded or included in this message.
